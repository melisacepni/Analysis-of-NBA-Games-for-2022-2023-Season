## Analysis of NBA Games for 2022-2023 Season


### Project Overview

This project was a term project for STAT250, Applied Statistics, course from METU. 
The main aim of this project was to analyze and interpret the factors affect the points earned by NBA teams and players.
Throughout the project, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), enhancing our proficiency in Python and R programming languages. 


### Data Source

Data was taken from the NBA offical website  and transferred to an Excel file. The variables we needed were written in the excel file. 
The data was checked first. Since there was no need for data cleaning the data was used directly. The excel file used in this project has been uploaded.

### Conclusion

In this project, we developed our skills in data visualization and the interpretation of statistical data.
